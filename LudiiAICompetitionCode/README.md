## Important Notes on Ludii API Backwards Compatibility

This repository, as well as the [Ludii Example AI repository](https://github.com/Ludeme/LudiiExampleAI),
are written for the latest public pre-release of Ludii available at the time of this writing: Ludii 0.6.0.
At this point, **we cannot guarantee that the API provided by Ludii in future versions will be fully backwards
compatible**. We do not expect any drastic changes, and upgrades to future versions should be relatively easy
and only require minor changes, but will likely require more than 0 changes.

From Ludii version 1.0.0 onwards, we aim to preserve backwards compatibility.

# Ludii AI Competition Code

This part of the repository contains some utility code that entrants of Ludii AI Competitions
may find useful. We may occasionally update it with extra utilities. For instance, we plan to
add code here later that entrants may use to run mock competitions on their own hardware, and
test that their agents do not violate any rules (such as computation time restrictions).

Note that this repository does not include examples of AI implementations. See the
[Ludii Example AI repository](https://github.com/Ludeme/LudiiExampleAI) for example implementations
of AIs.

Code in this repository requires a Ludii.jar file as a dependency.
